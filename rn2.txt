[Markup information: 

This is in the form of tags <>

[Structure of an HTML document:

	Head > title
HTML > 
	Body > p

[History of HTML:

Initially designed by one person, Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. Was scientifically related, 
suggested by the CERN research center.
Several revisions to the initial HTML version would ensue over the years, few of them 
redundant. 
XHTML was then introduced, XHTML 1.0, Extensible Hyper-text Markup language. XHTML is
 semantically identical to HTML.
Syntactically, XHTML 1.0 is also the same as HTML 4.01 except that XHTML restricts some
 of HTML's generality ina  few small
ways. 

There are two types of syntax, Concrete and abstract. 

The abstract syntax of a language defines a language at the level of abstract syntax
 trees. For HTML and XHTML languages, this
primarily involves defining what elements can be contained in the tree and what attributes
 can be associated with each element.


the Concrete syntax of a language defines how this tree structure is represented within the
 language. In the case of XHTML
and HTMl, this involves a variety of low-level details, such as what charcatcers are used to delimit tags 


the primary concrete syntactic restrictions on XHTML include the follwing:

* Omiited tags are nto allowed.
* All element and attribute names must be lowercased. 
* All attribute values must be quoted. 

[Document type Declaration:

Every XHTML document must have a document type declaration on the top. 

Eg: <!DOCTYPE html

[White Space 

White space is treated as a word separator. the net affect is that the browser replaces any string of white space characters within 
character data by a single blank.

[Spacing: pre and br

the pre element is used to override a browser's normal white space processing.

Eg:

<pre>
use pre (for 'preformatted") to
	preserve white space and use
		monospace type.
(But note that tags such as <br />Still work!)
</pre>


the br element is an example of an empty element. An empty element is one that is not allowed to contain content. That is, it is syntactically illegal
to write HTML markup such as
<br>
Content of the br element
</br>


[the img element is the primary element for including a graphic in the document. 

[Relative URLs:

a string, that is consistent with the URL path syntax, is known as a relative URL; certain other strings are also valid relative URLs.
Subsequently, every relative URl is shorthand for some abolsute URl. 

[Lists:

there are three types of lists;

*Unordered: A bullet list
*ordered: A numbered list
*Definition: A list fo terms and definitions for each.

[Tables:

HTMl provides a fairly sophisticated model for presenting data in tabular form. Columns and rows will automatically size to contain their data, 
although there are also various options for changing the visual appearance of a table, such as the width of its internal cell-spearating lines and
external borders.
